      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstractï¼š&lt;/em&gt; Nowadays, O2O commercial platforms are playing a crucial
role in our daily purchases. However, some people are trying to manipulate the online market maliciously by opinion spamming, a kind of web
fraud behavior like writing fake reviews, due to fame and profits, which
will harm online purchasing environment and should be detected and
eliminated. Moreover, manual fake reviewers are more deceptive compared with old web spambots. Although several efficient methods were
proposed in the fake review detection field, the manual fake reviewers
are also evolving rapidly. They imitate to be benign users to control
the velocity of review fraud actions, and deceive the detection system.
Our investigation presented that geolocation factor is potential and can
well reflect the distinctions between fake reviewers and benign users. In
this research, we analyzed the geolocations of shops in reviews, found
the distinct distribution features of those in fake reviewers and benign
users, and proposed a SpamTracer model that can identify fake reviewers and benign users by exploiting an improved HMM(Hidden Markov
Model). Our experiment demonstrated that SpamTracer could achieve
71% accuracy and 76% recall in the unbalanced dataset, outperforming
some excellent classical approaches in the aspect of stability. Furthermore, SpamTracer can help to analyze the regularities of review fraud
actions. Those regularities reflect the time and location in which online
shops are likely to hire fake reviewers to increase their turnover. We also
found that a small group of fake reviewers tend to work with plural shops
located in a small business zone.&lt;/p&gt;
