      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract:&lt;/em&gt; Automated fraud behaviors detection on electronic payment
platforms is a tough problem. Fraud users often exploit the
vulnerability of payment platforms and the carelessness of
users to defraud money, steal passwords, do money laundering, etc, which causes enormous losses to digital payment
platforms and users. There are many challenges for fraud
detection in practice. Traditional fraud detection methods
require a large-scale manually labeled dataset, which is hard
to obtain in reality. Manually labeled data cost tremendous
human efforts. Besides, the continuous and rapid evolution
of fraud users makes it hard to find new fraud patterns based
on existing detection rules. In our work, we propose a realworld data oriented detection paradigm which can detect
fraud users and upgrade its detection ability automatically.
Based on the new paradigm, we design a novel fraud detection model, FraudJudger, to analyze users behaviors on
digital payment platforms and detect fraud users with fewer
labeled data in training. FraudJudger can learn the latent
representations of users from unlabeled data with the help of
Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE). Furthermore, FraudJudger
can find new fraud patterns from unknown users by cluster
analysis. Our experiment is based on a real-world electronic
payment dataset. Comparing with other well-known fraud
detection methods, FraudJudger can achieve better detection
performance with only 10% labeled data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstractï¼š&lt;/em&gt; Nowadays, O2O commercial platforms are playing a crucial
role in our daily purchases. However, some people are trying to manipulate the online market maliciously by opinion spamming, a kind of web
fraud behavior like writing fake reviews, due to fame and profits, which
will harm online purchasing environment and should be detected and
eliminated. Moreover, manual fake reviewers are more deceptive compared with old web spambots. Although several efficient methods were
proposed in the fake review detection field, the manual fake reviewers
are also evolving rapidly. They imitate to be benign users to control
the velocity of review fraud actions, and deceive the detection system.
Our investigation presented that geolocation factor is potential and can
well reflect the distinctions between fake reviewers and benign users. In
this research, we analyzed the geolocations of shops in reviews, found
the distinct distribution features of those in fake reviewers and benign
users, and proposed a SpamTracer model that can identify fake reviewers and benign users by exploiting an improved HMM(Hidden Markov
Model). Our experiment demonstrated that SpamTracer could achieve
71% accuracy and 76% recall in the unbalanced dataset, outperforming
some excellent classical approaches in the aspect of stability. Furthermore, SpamTracer can help to analyze the regularities of review fraud
actions. Those regularities reflect the time and location in which online
shops are likely to hire fake reviewers to increase their turnover. We also
found that a small group of fake reviewers tend to work with plural shops
located in a small business zone.&lt;/p&gt;
