      <title>Privacy in Data Sharing (cooperate with 360 company)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning requires a large amount of data in training. In many cases, we cannot get enough data we needed to train a deep learning model. Data are distributed in many owners. Due to privacy considerations, we cannot gather these data directly. A proper method for data sharing without privacy leakage is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a project cooperating with 360.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated fraud behaviors detection on electronic payment
platforms is a tough problem. Fraud users often exploit the
vulnerability of payment platforms and the carelessness of
users to defraud money, steal passwords, do money laundering, etc, which causes enormous losses to digital payment
platforms and users. There are many challenges for fraud
detection in practice. Traditional fraud detection methods
require a large-scale manually labeled dataset, which is hard
to obtain in reality. Manually labeled data cost tremendous
human efforts. Besides, the continuous and rapid evolution
of fraud users makes it hard to find new fraud patterns based
on existing detection rules. In our work, we propose a real-world data oriented detection paradigm which can detect
fraud users and upgrade its detection ability automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-overview&#34;&gt;Model Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Model overview&#34; src=&#34;paper.png&#34; width=&#34;800&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the overview of our detection model.
Our
model should contain two main functions: building fraud
users blacklist and automatically updating the blacklist. The whole
detection model contains three phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase I:&lt;/strong&gt; Merging features from raw data. Platforms collect two main classes of information: operation data and
transaction data. We first merge the two classes data, and
the merged features are passed to our fraud detection part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase II:&lt;/strong&gt; Building fraud users blacklist. Merged features
in Phase I are of high dimensions, which can not be used
directly. We can omit ineffective and noisy features and get
efficient low dimension features with the help of adversarial
autoencoder. In the meantime, we can detect fraud users by
a few labeled data. It is a semi-supervised learning process.
Detected fraud users will be added in the blacklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase III:&lt;/strong&gt; Updating fraud users blacklist by cluster analysis. The key idea is to find new fraud users beyond existing
detection rules. In this phase, we train a new AAE network
without labels to learn the latent representations of users.
Then we cluster these latent variables from the network.
After clustering latent variables, different users groups are
formed. We detect fraud users with new patterns from these
fraud groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of our research is shown in our paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://dengruoyu.github.io/Publications/arxiv.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FraudJudger: Real-World Data Oriented Fraud Detection on Digital Payment Platforms (arxiv)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dengruoyu.github.io/Publications/FraudJudger.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FraudJudger: Fraud Detection on Digital Payment Platforms with Fewer Labels (ICICS 2019).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a project cooperating with tiancheng.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
