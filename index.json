Manual fake reviews imitate honest reviews in many ways; hence they are more deceptive and harmful than botnet reviews. Several efficient methods have been proposed to detect fake reviews, but manual fake reviewers are evolving rapidly. They pretend to be benign users, control the velocity of re- view fraud actions, and deceive detection systems. Previous work has focused on the contents of reviews or the information of reviewers. We find that geolocation factors have potential and have been neglected in most studies. Our research indicates that geolocation can well distinguish between fake reviewers and benign users on an O2O platform. We propose a manual fake review detection model, the geolocation- based account detection model (GADM), which combines the AdaBoost model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze a user’s account and geolocation information, achieving 83.3% accuracy and an 86.2% F1-score on a Yelp dataset. We also propose a high-efficiency algorithm to detect review fraud groups.\n","date":1572739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572739200,"objectID":"f27f2818f71a96e9e776723e8fabb03d","permalink":"https://dengruoyu.github.io/publication/journal-article/gadm-manual-fake-review-detection-for-o2o/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/gadm-manual-fake-review-detection-for-o2o/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract: O2O (online to offline) commercial platforms, such as Yelp, play a crucial role in our daily purchases.

In our work, we propose a realworld data oriented detection paradigm which can detect fraud users and upgrade its detection ability automatically. Based on the new paradigm, we design a novel fraud detection model, FraudJudger, to analyze users behaviors on digital payment platforms and detect fraud users with fewer labeled data in training. FraudJudger can learn the latent representations of users from unlabeled data with the help of Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE). Furthermore, FraudJudger can find new fraud patterns from unknown users by cluster analysis. Our experiment is based on a real-world electronic payment dataset. Comparing with other well-known fraud detection methods, FraudJudger can achieve better detection performance with only 10% labeled data.\n","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"f66870cb25186c62f98f39c8cc6b6069","permalink":"https://dengruoyu.github.io/publication/conference-paper/fraudjudger-real-world-data-oriented-fraud/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/fraudjudger-real-world-data-oriented-fraud/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract: Automated fraud behaviors detection on electronic payment platforms is a tough problem.

In our work, we propose a real-world data oriented detection paradigm which can detect fraud users and upgrade its detection ability automatically.\nModel Overview This is the overview of our detection model. Our model should contain two main functions: building fraud users blacklist and automatically updating the blacklist. The whole detection model contains three phases:\nPhase I: Merging features from raw data. Platforms collect two main classes of information: operation data and transaction data. We first merge the two classes data, and the merged features are passed to our fraud detection part.\nPhase II: Building fraud users blacklist. Merged features in Phase I are of high dimensions, which can not be used directly. We can omit ineffective and noisy features and get efficient low dimension features with the help of adversarial autoencoder. In the meantime, we can detect fraud users by a few labeled data. It is a semi-supervised learning process. Detected fraud users will be added in the blacklist.\nPhase III: Updating fraud users blacklist by cluster analysis. The key idea is to find new fraud users beyond existing detection rules. In this phase, we train a new AAE network without labels to learn the latent representations of users. Then we cluster these latent variables from the network. After clustering latent variables, different users groups are formed. We detect fraud users with new patterns from these fraud groups.\nThe details of our research is shown in our paper \u0026ldquo;FraudJudger: Real-World Data Oriented Fraud Detection on Digital Payment Platforms\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is a project cooperating with tiancheng.\n","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"8b82b6b87a369a5d7bc16a201909b520","permalink":"https://dengruoyu.github.io/project/tiancheng/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tiancheng/","section":"project","summary":"Project Description Automated fraud behaviors detection on electronic payment platforms is a tough problem.

Our experiment demonstrated that SpamTracer could achieve 71% accuracy and 76% recall in the unbalanced dataset, outperforming some excellent classical approaches in the aspect of stability. Furthermore, SpamTracer can help to analyze the regularities of review fraud actions. Those regularities reflect the time and location in which online shops are likely to hire fake reviewers to increase their turnover. We also found that a small group of fake reviewers tend to work with plural shops located in a small business zone.\n","date":1544745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544745600,"objectID":"b0b0f80b2b66dabadbe0f427d34c9f0e","permalink":"https://dengruoyu.github.io/publication/conference-paper/spamtracer-manual-fake-review-detection-for-o2o-commercial-platforms-by-using-geolocation-features/","publishdate":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/spamtracer-manual-fake-review-detection-for-o2o-commercial-platforms-by-using-geolocation-features/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract： Nowadays, O2O commercial platforms are playing a crucial role in our daily purchases.
